# gulp-boilerplate

The new Realise web-dev project boilerplate.  Fancy title to be decided.  Provides Sass compilation, svg sprite builder, js browserify, html templating, code linting etc.  See the [wiki](https://github.com/realise-labs/gulp-boilerplate/wiki) for more details.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the boilerplate up and running on your local machine.

### Requirements

What things you need to install the software and how to install them


* Node.js
* Gulp
* Your favorite text-editor


### Installing

If you haven't already.  Download and install Node from here: https://nodejs.org/

Then install glup globally on your machine by typing the following into the commandline. 

```
npm install -g gulp
```

If you have previously installed Node and Gulp, you can skip straight to the installation of the project. 

If you don't normally use the comandline there are some automated scripts to help you out from here on in.

Double click the install.bat file in the project root or  navigate to the root directory and type the following in the comand line.

```
npm install
```

Boom!  You now have the gulp-boilerplate installed in your local project.  Congratulations.
